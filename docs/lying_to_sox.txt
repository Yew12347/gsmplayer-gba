# In SoX v12.7.3 (from 16 December 2001), this command used to
# produce wave files in the nonstandard rate used by GSM Player:
#
#     sox hello.wav -r 18157 -c 1 hello.gsm
#
# But by SoX v14.4.2 (in Ubuntu 18.04), SoX became much pickier
# about the output sample rate for certain formats, producing the
# following error message with no obvious option to override:
#
#     sox WARN formats: gsm can't encode at 18157Hz; using 8000Hz
#
# Now you have to trick SoX into ignoring this mismatch by using two
# SoX processes, one to resample the audio and one to encode it, and
# lying to the second one about the sample rate of its input.

sox /home/pino/develop/action53/audio/selnow.wav -r 18157 -t s16 -c 1 - | sox -t s16 -r 8000 -c 1 - selnow.gsm

# It also takes two SoX processes to play a file encoded this way:

sox selnow.gsm -t s16 - | play -t s16 -r 18157 -c 1 -

# This one works too, suggested by mGBA developer Vicki "endrift" Pfau.
# Fortunately for us, FFmpeg allows overriding its sample rate check
# with the -strict flag.
ffmpeg -i '/home/pino/Music/Mr. Mister - Kyrie.mp3' -ac 1 -af 'aresample=18157' -strict unofficial -c:a gsm Kyrie.gsm
ffplay -ar 18157 Kyrie.gsm
