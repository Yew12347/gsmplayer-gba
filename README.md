GSM Player
==========

From mid-2004 to mid-2019, [GSM Player for GBA] went unmaintained,
and changes to popular GBA homebrew toolchains rendered it
unbuildable. but [pinobatch/gsmplayer-gba](https://github.com/pinobatch/gsmplayer-gba) ported this to newer version of devkitarm
and this is a fork of that

Notes
--------------
thanks to [git2358/gsmplayer-gba](https://github.com/git2358/gsmplayer-gba) i just modified my build.bat a little bit more moking it download ffmpeg only 1 time insted of everytime (done this on school pc :D)
and this project wont get a lot of update because i dont have a lot of time but i will try my best to maintain it

Building a ROM
--------------
just put a song into the folder for it type and then run build.bat if you cant do it the version you dont have to build is on the way

Controls
--------
To control the player:

- Left: Previous track
- Right: Next track
- B: Seek backward
- A: Seek forward
- Select: Lock other keys
- Start: Pause or resume
